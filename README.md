## [LIVE DEMO](#)

## Description: 

This application serves as my skills test for [Coalition Technologies](https://coalitiontechnologies.com/) front-end job. This test aims to see how well I can convert an Adobe Photoshop file into a static, one-page web application. The main objective is to create a responsive single-page website from the given PSD. This entails ensuring that the carousel seamlessly adapts to various screen sizes, and on mobile devices, the tabs should gracefully transition into an accordion layout for improved usability.


## Tools Used: 


* [Swiper Js](https://swiper.com/)
* [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)
* [Adobe Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html)
